WARNING:tensorflow:From /Library/Python/3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/dispatch.py:1260: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
