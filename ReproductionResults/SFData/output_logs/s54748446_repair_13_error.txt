WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/usi/Documents/RealBugsAnalysis/sfdata/runs/s54748446_ground_truth.py:17: DatasetV1.make_initializable_iterator (from tensorflow.python.data.ops.dataset_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This is a deprecated API that should only be used in TF 1 graph mode and legacy TF 2 graph mode available through `tf.compat.v1`. In all other situations -- namely, eager mode and inside `tf.function` -- you can consume dataset elements using `for elem in dataset: ...` or by explicitly creating iterator via `iterator = iter(dataset)` and fetching its elements via `values = next(iterator)`. Furthermore, this API is not available in TF 2. During the transition from TF 1 to TF 2 you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_initializable_iterator(dataset)` to create a TF 1 graph mode style iterator for a dataset created through TF 2 APIs. Note that this should be a transient state of your code base as there are in general no guarantees about the interoperability of TF 1 and TF 2 code.
